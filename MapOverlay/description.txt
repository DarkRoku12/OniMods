A new overlay that serves as a map of the world, making the locations of Geysers, Critters and important Buildings obvious by highligthing them. Also shows spots of Neutronium to help detecting buried Geysers, and an optional mode even identifies the buried Geysers.

The following objects are highlighted in the map overview:

[list]
[*] Geysers: All Geysers, Vents, Volcanos and Fissures from the base game, the "Spaced Out" DLC, any future updates and mods. Plus Oil Reservoirs (technically not Geysers) and Neutronium, so you can spot buried Geysers.
[*] Geysers (incl. buried): The same, but including those that are still buried (but not hidden behind the Fog of War)
[*] Critters: All Critters from the base game, the "Space Out" DLC, and... you know the text already
[*] Plants: The same, but with plants
[*] Buildings: Printing Pod, Anti-Entropy Thermo-Nullifiers (AETNs) and Neural Vacillators from the base game, Port-a-Pods, Teleporters and Warp Pipes from the "spaced Out" DLC
[*] Biomes: All biomes (though currently and temporarily displayed with their code names, e.g. "FrozenWastes")
[/list]

The overlay's legend always only contains those objects that are present on your map (and that you already have discovered), so you'll get a quick overview of what you got on the map by just looking at the legend.

The mod is best used in a zoom-out view. For this, use the game's screenshot mode (Alt + S) or Cairath's great [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1717463209]Bigger Camera Zoom Out[/url] mod.
